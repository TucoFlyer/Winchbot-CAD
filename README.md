# Winchbot-CAD

Mechanical design for a 1D robot that can raise and lower a load suspended on paracord.

Multiple winchbots can be networked via Ethernet to move a load in 3D space.

* Mostly 3D printed parts
* Compact and fully enclosed
* Designed for approx 5kg max dynamic load and 2.5kg static
* Plenty of spool space for moving loads in very large spaces
* Closed loop control of cord movement using a feedback capstan
* Force sensing using a load cell, for load position feedback and jam detection
